📊 Project-NYSE: Financial & Forecasting Dashboard

This project showcases my end-to-end analytical process — from working with raw financial data in Excel to building a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with sector-level forecasting.

Using historical financial data (2012–2016) from NYSE-listed companies, I developed a clear analytical story that visualizes how each sector contributes to market performance and how forecasting models can project future trends (2017–2018).

📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates my capabilities as a Business & Data Analyst by transforming raw, unstructured financial data into actionable insights.

Starting from Excel, I:

Cleaned and modeled multi-year financial data (Revenue, Operating Expense, and Profit)

Built pivot tables and sector-level reports to uncover patterns in company performance

Designed forecasting models to simulate potential outcomes for 2017–2018

Then, in Power BI, I:

Created a dynamic dashboard summarizing total revenue, expenses, gross profit, and growth across seven key sectors

Integrated forecast visuals to show how performance might evolve under different market conditions

Highlighted the connection between data analysis and investment decision-making — similar to how funds like PIF evaluate sector-level behavior

The project aims to demonstrate how financial data, when properly analyzed and visualized, can support strategic investment thinking and evidence-based decisions.
